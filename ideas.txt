ideas for improving project

   at some point I should put all of my apcs projects on git hub 
   just for future reference
      see flash drive and personal laptop

   somehow make the format of files easier to read, or a way to 
   have the formatting of the input file less strict?
      ideas for different format options 
      
   for the InOrder game, make it clear for the user that when
   they get an incorrect answer they have to proceed to the next one
   
   does it shuffle efficiently? make sure that it doesn't repeat 
   the things for the matching/recall games very often
   
   make it quit after you get (3) things incorrect
      but what if there are only 3 elements? or make it so that the number
      allowed to get incorrect is dependent on the number of elements
      in the array or file 
   
   //done
   
   make the help() method easier to understand/condense it
   
   do I actually use all of the methods in the Student
   class? check to see which ones are necessary
      getMethod() not needed
     
   give the user the ability to type different answers
   instead of "true" or "false" like "t" or "f" or 
   "yes" or "no" for all games and all possible 
   files 
   
   look for areas to make it less redundant
      InOrder class: printAndCheck() method
      already did boolean zen in the character part of the print and check method, now just need to do
      the same kind of re formatting in the word part of the if statement
