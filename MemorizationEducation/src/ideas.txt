ideas for improving project

   //for the other person
   
   in the in order game, for the words part, have it say "what is after (the entire file that it has gone through so far)"
      instead of just saying "what is after (the most recent term)"
      
   in the in order game, for the characters part, have it say "what is after (the entire file that it has gone through so far)"
      instead of just saying "what is after (the first instance of the most recent term)"
      since some characters repeat, (3.1415926) the current string that it prints will stop at the first occurance of the last 
      character, instead of going through and printing everything that it has cycled through up to then
      
   maybe within the loop when it continues through the file, and a summation string that continuously adds the most recent correct
      answer to the string, then that string is the one that's printed when it prompts "what is after (string)"
         for the words game, it has to add a space inbetween each element
   
     
   //done
   
   make the help() method easier to understand/condense it
   
   do I actually use all of the methods in the Student
   class? check to see which ones are necessary
      getMethod() not needed
     
   give the user the ability to type different answers
   instead of "true" or "false" like "t" or "f" or 
   "yes" or "no" for all games and all possible 
   files 
   
   look for areas to make it less redundant
      InOrder class: printAndCheck() method
      already did boolean zen in the character part of the print and check method, now just need to do
      the same kind of re formatting in the word part of the if statement
      
   for the InOrder game, make it clear for the user that when
   they get an incorrect answer they have to proceed to the next one
   
   at some point I should put all of my apcs projects on git hub 
   just for future reference
      see flash drive and personal laptop
      
    make it quit after you get (3) things incorrect
      but what if there are only 3 elements? or make it so that the number
      allowed to get incorrect is dependent on the number of elements
      in the array or file
